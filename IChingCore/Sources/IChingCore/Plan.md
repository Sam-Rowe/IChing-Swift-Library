Here is a concise testing plan for your Swift library, tailored to your `IChingCore` codebase:

**1. Unit Tests (Core Logic)**
- [x] Test `IChing.ask(_:)` for deterministic output given a question. *Inject or mock the random seed/generator to ensure reproducibility.* Test exists but does not pass; we get unexpected line values. ⚠️
- [x] Test `generateALine(using:)` for valid line values (6, 7, 8, 9). *Use a fixed or mocked generator for deterministic results.*
- [x] Test `generateComposite(numberOfStalks:using:)` for correct stalk usage and error handling. ✅
- [x] Test `getRemainder(pile:)` for correct remainder logic. ✅
- [x] Test `seed(from:)` for consistent seeding. ✅
- [x] Test `SeededGenerator` for reproducible random sequences. ✅

**2. Hexagram Logic**
- [x] Test `findHexagram(from:)` for correct mapping from `[Bool]` to `Hexagram`. ✅
- [x] Test `applyChanges(to:changes:)` for correct line mutation. ✅

**3. Integration Tests**
- [x] Test full reading generation: input a question, verify the resulting `Reading` and `Hexagram` are valid and consistent. *Inject or mock the random generator to ensure deterministic integration tests.* ⚠️ (Test passes, but with warnings and a runtime error that should be investigated)
- [x] Test edge cases: empty question, special characters, very long input. ⚠️ (Test passes, but with warnings)

**4. Error Handling**
- [x] Test error cases in `generateComposite` (invalid stalks). ✅
- [x] Test for forced failures (e.g., invalid hexagram lines, unexpected line values, error propagation in `generateALine` and `ask`). ✅
- [x] Test that `ask(_:)` returns nil if an error occurs. ✅

**5. Performance Tests (Optional)**
- [ ] Benchmark `ask(_:)` for large numbers of calls.

**Additional Resilience Tests Added**
- [x] Test that `ask(_:seed:)` throws on unexpected line values.
- [x] Test that `generateALine(using:)` throws if composite logic fails.
- [x] Test that `ask(_:)` returns nil if an error occurs.

All new tests are implemented and passing, and the error handling in the core logic is now robust and testable.

**Order of Implementation**
1. Unit tests for pure functions (`getRemainder`, `seed`, `applyChanges`). ✅
2. Unit tests for random and composite logic (`generateALine`, `generateComposite`, `SeededGenerator`). *Ensure all randomness is controlled via dependency injection or mocking for deterministic tests.*
3. Hexagram mapping and validation. ✅
4. Integration tests for `ask(_:)` and full reading flow. *Use injected/mocked randomness for reproducibility.* ⚠️
5. Error and edge case tests. ⚠️
6. Performance tests if needed.

**Test Framework**
- Use XCTest (standard for Swift).
- Place tests in a separate `IChingCoreTests` target.

**Additional Notes**
- Where possible, use dependency injection or mocking for any randomness to ensure all tests are deterministic and reproducible.
- ⚠️ Some tests pass but emit warnings or runtime errors. Review and address these issues for full reliability.

This plan ensures core logic is robust before moving to integration and edge cases, and that all tests are reliable and repeatable.
